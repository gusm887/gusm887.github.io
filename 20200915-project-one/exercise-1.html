    <h2>VT323</h2>
    <p>I decided to narrow my choice down to the font that's so unique (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323">VT323</a>), it looks like it was made with pixel art, VT323. This font was created by Peter Hull, he used glyphs from a DECVT320 terminal and used this font in college. Peter used gimp, python/PIL, and FontForge to make the font as close as possible to the original glyphs from the terminal. VT323 seemed to be made for the author's nostalgia.
