       <h1>The Harionago</h1>
<p>Harionago (whose name means "Barbed Woman") is said to take the form of a beautiful woman with extremely long hair tipped with thorn-like barbs who wanders the roads of the Japanese prefecture of Ehime on the island of Shikoku searching for young male victims, when approached she will laugh at her intended victim and if he is foolish enough to laugh back she will lunge at him, animating her hair and use the barbs to kill the unfortunate individual before going back to her usual drifting. Like the oni, she seems to kill soley for enjoyment
