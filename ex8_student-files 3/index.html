<p>The Japanese words miko and fujo ("female shaman" and "shrine maiden" respectively[10]) are usually written 巫女[10] as a compound of the kanji 巫 ("shaman"), and 女 ("woman").[10] Miko was archaically written 神子 (literally "kami" or "god" + "child")[10] and 巫子 ("shaman child").[10]

<p>Miko once performed spirit possession and takusen (whereby the possessed person serves as a "medium" (yorimashi) to communicate the divine will or message of that kami or spirit; also included in the category of takusen is "dream revelation" (mukoku), in which a kami appears in a dream to communicate its will)[11] as vocational functions in their service to shrines. As time passed, they left the shrines and began working independently in secular society. Miko at shrines today do no more than sit at reception counters and perform kagura dance. In addition to a medium or a miko (or a Geki, which is a male shaman), the site of a takusen may occasionally also be attended by a sayaniwa[12] who interprets the words of the possessed person to make them comprehensible to other people present. Kamigakari and takusen[11] may be passive, when a person speaks after suddenly becoming involuntarily possessed or has a dream revelation; they can also be active, when spirit possession is induced in a specific person to ascertain the divine will or gain a divine revelation.[11]

        <p>Miko are known by many names; Fairchild lists 26 terms for "shrine-attached Miko"[13] and 43 for "non-shrine-attached Miko".[14] Other names are ichiko (巫子, "shaman child", or 市子, "market/town child", both likely instances of ateji) meaning "female medium; fortuneteller",[10] and reibai (霊媒) meaning "spirit go-between, medium").[10]
        In English, the word is often translated as "shrine maiden", though freer renderings often simply use the phrase "female shaman" (shamanka[citation needed]) or, as Lafcadio Hearn translated it, "Divineress".[15]
        Some scholars[citation needed] prefer the transliteration, contrasting the Japanese Mikoism[citation needed] with other Asian terms for female shamans.[citation needed] As Fairchild explains:
